      HTMl elements have opening tags like <span class="tag">&lt;h1&gt;</span>  and closing tags like <span class="tag">&lt;/h1&gt;</span> . The text an element will display goes between its opening and closing tags. The h1 through h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, so h2 elements have less importance than h1 elements.
     Only use one h1 element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.</p>

        The p element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites.<br>Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive. A  comment in HTML starts with <span class="tag">&lt;!--</span>, contains any number of lines of text, and ends with <span class="tag">--></span>

        HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility. The main element is used to represent the main content of the body of an HTML document. Content inside the main element should be unique to the document and should not be repeated in other parts of the document.

        You can add images to your website by using the <span class="tag">img</span> element. <span class="tag">img</span> elements have an opening tag without a closing tag. An element without a closing tag is known as a <strong>void element</strong>. HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag of an element to control the element's behavior. The <span class="tag">src</span> attribute in an img element specifies the image's URL (where the image is located).
