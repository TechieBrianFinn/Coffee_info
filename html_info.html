    <h1>All About HTML 5</h1>
    <p>
      HTMl elements have opening tags like <span class="tag">&lt;h1&gt;</span>  and closing tags like <span class="tag">&lt;/h1&gt;</span> . The text an element will display goes between its opening and closing tags. The h1 through h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, so h2 elements have less importance than h1 elements.
     Only use one h1 element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.</p>

    <p>
        The p element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites.<br>Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive. A  comment in HTML starts with <span class="tag">&lt;!--</span>, contains any number of lines of text, and ends with <span class="tag">--></span>
